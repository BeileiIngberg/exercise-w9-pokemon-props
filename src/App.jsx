/*
Using the data.json you will create a list of pokemons.
We've created the necessary components for you, now it's
up to you to pass the props properly (ðŸ˜…) to these
components. Begin with the Pokemon's names, and continue on
with their types. Don't forget the key! Read more here:
https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html

/*Extra!
Feel free to create more components, such as header/footer,
or why not include some more data from the array? */
